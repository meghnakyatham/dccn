Aim

To demonstrate different types of network topologies and transmission media using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Theory (Expanded, Simple, and Easy)

A network topology refers to the physical or logical arrangement of computers, switches, routers, and communication links in a network. Understanding topologies is essential for designing efficient, reliable, and cost-effective networks.

1. Bus Topology

All devices are connected to a single central cable called a bus.

Only one device transmits at a time.

Failure of the main cable affects the entire network.

Shown on Page 2 image, where multiple PCs connect to one horizontal line.

2. Star Topology

All devices connect to a central hub or switch.

If one device fails, others continue working.

Common in modern LANs because it's reliable and easy to manage.

3. Ring Topology

Devices are connected in a circular loop.

Data travels in one direction around the ring using a token (Token Ring network).

Failure of any device breaks the entire ring unless redundant paths exist.

Page 2 image clearly shows the circular connection.

4. Mesh Topology

Every device is connected to every other device.

Provides full redundancy and reliability.

Very expensive due to high cabling and port requirements.

Used in networks where reliability is critical.

5. Tree / Hybrid Topology

Combines features of star and bus topologies.

A central backbone cable connects multiple star networks.

Easy to scale and manage as the network grows.

Transmission Media (Expanded)

Transmission media carry data signals between devices. Packet Tracer provides different types:

1. Copper Cables (Wired)

Straight-through → PC to switch / switch to router

Cross-over → PC to PC or switch to switch

Coaxial → Used in old bus networks

Affordable and easy to install

2. Fiber-Optic Cable

Very high speed

Long-distance communication

Used between routers, servers, and backbone networks

3. Wireless Media

Uses radio waves

Requires Access Points (APs)

Easy to install and suitable for mobile devices

Demonstrated by adding wireless PCs/laptops

Procedure

Open Packet Tracer.

For each topology (Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree), place PCs and connect using suitable cables.

Add transmission media such as straight-through cable, cross-over cable, fiber cable, and wireless access point.

Test connectivity using ping from one PC to another.

Observe packet movement in simulation mode.

Conclusion

Different network topologies and transmission media were successfully created and tested in Packet Tracer, showing how networks are structured and how data travels between devices.
