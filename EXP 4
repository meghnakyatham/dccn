Aim

To demonstrate different types of network topologies and transmission media using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Theory (Very Simple)

A network topology is the way computers and devices are connected.
Common topologies:

Bus – All devices connected to one main cable.

Star – Devices connected to a central switch/hub.

Ring – Devices connected in a circular loop.

Mesh – Every device connects to every other device.

Tree/Hybrid – Combination of bus and star structures.

Transmission media include copper cables, fiber cables, and wireless signals.

Procedure

Open Packet Tracer.

For each topology (Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree), place PCs and connect using suitable cables.

Add transmission media such as straight-through cable, cross-over cable, fiber cable, and wireless access point.

Test connectivity using ping from one PC to another.

Observe packet movement in simulation mode.

Conclusion

Different network topologies and transmission media were successfully created and tested in Packet Tracer, showing how networks are structured and how data travels between devices.
