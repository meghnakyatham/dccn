Aim

To capture and study the TCP Three-Way Handshake process using Wireshark and understand the roles of SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets in establishing a TCP connection. 


Theory (Very Simple & Short)

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means it must create a reliable connection before sending data.
This connection is created using the Three-Way Handshake, which happens in three steps:

SYN – The client sends a request to start communication.

SYN-ACK – The server accepts the request and responds back.

ACK – The client confirms, and the connection is officially established.

This process ensures both devices agree on starting communication and synchronize their sequence numbers. Wireshark helps capture these packets so we can see exactly how the connection begins. 


Procedure (Short & Easy)

Open Wireshark and start capturing packets on the active network interface.

Open a web browser and visit http://example.com
 to generate TCP traffic.

Stop the capture after the page loads.

Apply the filter tcp to see only TCP packets.

Identify the handshake:

- Look for the SYN packet (client → server).

- Then find the SYN-ACK packet (server → client).

- Then find the ACK packet (client → server).

Click the packets to view sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers.

To calculate RTT:

- Right-click the SYN packet → “Set Time Reference.”

- Check the time difference when the SYN-ACK arrives. 


Conclusion

Using Wireshark, the complete TCP Three-Way Handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) was successfully captured and analyzed. The packets clearly showed how the client and server synchronize and establish a reliable TCP connection, along with the RTT calculated from the time difference between the SYN and SYN-ACK packets.
