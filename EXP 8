Aim

To develop a DNS client-server program that resolves hostnames to IP addresses and vice-versa.

Expanded Theory (Simple & Clear)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is an essential service that converts human-friendly names such as www.google.com
 into machine-friendly IP addresses like 142.250.190.68.

1. DNS Structure

DNS is a distributed hierarchical system. It consists of:

Root servers

Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers (like .com, .org)

Authoritative DNS servers (store actual domain→IP mappings)

2. DNS Server

Stores domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.

Responds to client queries.

Can perform forward lookup (name → IP) and reverse lookup (IP → name).

3. DNS Client (Resolver)

Sends queries to the DNS server.

Takes user input (hostname or IP).

Displays the resolved address.

4. How DNS Resolution Works

Client sends a query to DNS server.

Server checks its database or cache.

If record exists, it returns the answer.

If not, returns “No record found.”

DNS generally uses UDP port 53 for queries because it is fast. For large responses, it may use TCP port 53.
Procedure

Start a UDP server with a predefined DNS table.

Accept hostname or IP from client.

Server checks its dictionary.

If match found, send the mapped value.

If not found, reply “No record found”.

Display result at client side.

Conclusion

A simple DNS system was created using UDP sockets. The client successfully resolved hostnames to IP addresses and performed reverse lookups.
