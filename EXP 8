Aim

To develop a DNS client-server program that resolves hostnames to IP addresses and vice-versa.

Theory (Very Simple)

DNS translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
A DNS server stores mappings, and a DNS client sends queries to get the matching result.

Procedure

Start a UDP server with a predefined DNS table.

Accept hostname or IP from client.

Server checks its dictionary.

If match found, send the mapped value.

If not found, reply “No record found”.

Display result at client side.

Conclusion

A simple DNS system was created using UDP sockets. The client successfully resolved hostnames to IP addresses and performed reverse lookups.
