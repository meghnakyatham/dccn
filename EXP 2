Aim

To capture and analyze network packets using Wireshark and understand how basic protocols like ICMP work during a ping operation. 

Theory (Very Simple & Short)

In computer networks, data is sent in small units called packets. To understand how these packets move and what information they carry, we can use a tool called Wireshark. It captures and shows all packets going in and out of a computer in real time.

Wireshark helps us see important details like source IP, destination IP, protocol used, and packet type.

When we use the ping command, it sends ICMP Echo Request packets and receives ICMP Echo Reply packets. Wireshark allows us to view these packets and understand how connectivity between two devices is tested.

Procedure (Simple Steps)

Open Wireshark on your computer.

Select the active network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and click Start to capture packets.

Open Command Prompt and type:
ping google.com
This generates ICMP traffic.

Go back to Wireshark and apply the filter:
icmp
to view only ping packets.

Click any ICMP packet and check:

- Source IP

- Destination IP

- ICMP Type (8 = Echo Request, 0 = Echo Reply)

- Sequence number and other details. 

Conclusion

Wireshark successfully captured and displayed ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply packets generated by the ping command. From the captured packets, we were able to observe the IP addresses, ICMP types, and other header details, helping us understand how network communication works at the packet level.
