Aim

To implement error detection and correction techniques using CRC and Hamming Code.

Theory (Very Simple)

CRC adds extra bits (FCS) to detect errors. If the receiver divides received data by the same polynomial and gets remainder 0, data is correct.

Hamming Code adds parity bits at positions 1, 2, 4, 8… These parity bits help detect and correct single-bit errors.

Procedure

Enter the data bits.

Calculate parity bits using XOR.

Form the encoded 7-bit or 8-bit Hamming Code.

Enter the received data bits.

Calculate the error position using parity checks.

Correct the error if found.

Conclusion

CRC and Hamming Code were successfully implemented, and errors were detected and corrected using parity calculations.
