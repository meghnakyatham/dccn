Aim

To implement error detection and correction techniques using CRC and Hamming Code.

Expanded Theory (Simple & Clear)

In digital communication, data sent from one device to another may get changed due to noise, interference, or faulty channels. Therefore, error detection and correction techniques are used to ensure that the received data is accurate.

1. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

CRC is an error-detection method where the sender performs a polynomial division on the data.

The sender adds extra bits called Frame Check Sequence (FCS) to the end of the message.

This FCS is chosen so that the entire message (data + CRC bits) becomes divisible by a predetermined generator polynomial.

The receiver performs the same division.

If the remainder is zero, the data is assumed to be correct; otherwise, an error is detected.

CRC is widely used in networks because it can detect common types of errors such as:

single-bit errors

double-bit errors

burst errors (when multiple bits are corrupted together)

2. Hamming Code

Hamming Code is an error-correcting code, not just error-detecting.
Invented by Richard Hamming, it uses redundancy bits placed at positions that are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8…).

Characteristics:

Detects two-bit errors

Corrects one-bit error without needing retransmission

How it works:

Parity bits are calculated based on the positions of the data bits.

If any bit is changed during transmission, the parity checks generate a binary number that directly points to the incorrect bit.

This makes correction very simple.

Thus, CRC detects errors and Hamming Code corrects errors. Together, they form the basis of reliable digital communication.
Procedure

Enter the data bits.

Calculate parity bits using XOR.

Form the encoded 7-bit or 8-bit Hamming Code.

Enter the received data bits.

Calculate the error position using parity checks.

Correct the error if found.

Conclusion

CRC and Hamming Code were successfully implemented, and errors were detected and corrected using parity calculations.
