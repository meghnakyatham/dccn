Aim

To simulate Go-Back-N (GBN) and Selective Repeat (SR) sliding window protocols.

Expanded Theory (Simple & Clear)

Flow control ensures that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver with too much data. In networks, data is divided into frames, and the receiver must be able to process them at the correct speed.

To manage this, Sliding Window Protocols are used. They allow the sender to transmit multiple frames before waiting for an acknowledgment.

Sliding Window Concept

The sender maintains a “window” of frames it can send without waiting for ACKs.

The receiver also has a window of frames it can accept.

This makes transmission faster and more efficient than sending one frame at a time.

Go-Back-N ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request)

If a frame is lost or damaged, the receiver discards that frame and all frames after it.

The sender must retransmit that frame and all subsequent frames, even if they were correct.

It is simple but wastes bandwidth on noisy networks.

Selective Repeat ARQ

Only the erroneous frame is retransmitted.

The receiver stores correctly received frames even if they come out of order.

More efficient but requires more memory and logic at the receiver.

Key Differences

Go-Back-N retransmits multiple frames, while Selective Repeat retransmits only the lost frame.

Go-Back-N requires less complexity and storage; Selective Repeat needs more buffer and sorting.

These protocols form the basis of TCP flow control in real networks.

Procedure

Enter number of frames to be sent.

Send frames 1 to N.

Randomly mark one frame as lost.

For GBN: retransmit that frame and all after it.

For SR: retransmit only the lost frame.

Display received data.

Conclusion

Both Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ were implemented. SR was shown to be more efficient as it retransmits only the damaged frame.
