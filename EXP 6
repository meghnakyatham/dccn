Aim

To simulate Go-Back-N (GBN) and Selective Repeat (SR) sliding window protocols.

Theory (Very Simple)

Flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.
Sliding window allows sending multiple frames:

Go-Back-N – If one frame is lost, the sender retransmits that frame and all frames after it.

Selective Repeat – Only the lost frame is retransmitted, making it more efficient.

Procedure

Enter number of frames to be sent.

Send frames 1 to N.

Randomly mark one frame as lost.

For GBN: retransmit that frame and all after it.

For SR: retransmit only the lost frame.

Display received data.

Conclusion

Both Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat ARQ were implemented. SR was shown to be more efficient as it retransmits only the damaged frame.
