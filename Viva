1. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol: delivery from source to destination
2. RTT - Round Trip Travel: Amount of time taken by the packet to travel from the source to the destination and back 
3. OSI - OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION 
- THIS MODEL IS USED TO DIVIDE THE NETWORK COMMUNICATION PROCESS INTO SMALLER AND SIMPLER STEPS 
- THIS MODEL ALSO PROVIDES THE MEANS OF CHANGING FUNCTIONALITIES IN ONE LAYER WITHOUT CHANGING THE OTHER LAYERS' FUNCTIONALITIES 
4. OSI MODEL: 7 LAYERS 
- PHYSICAL -> DATA LINK -> NETWORK -> TRANSPORT -> SESSION -> PRESENTATION -> APPLICATION 
5. Interoperability = different systems that are manufactured differently or uses different technologies working together without problems.
6. protocols: protocols are set of rules that 2 devices that wants to communicate to each other must follow. 
7. PPP is a protocol that connects two devices directly and manages data transfer between them.
8. Data Link Layer -> 2 types: 1. LLC (Logical Link layer) - upper sublayer 2. Media Access Control -lower sublayer
9. DNS, Domain Name System (Service) Protocol - Application layer protocol
10. DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration protocol  - application layer protocol
11. ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol: ICMP is a network-layer protocol used to send error messages and test connectivity between devices.
12. 1. Physical Layer

Carries raw bits (0s and 1s) over the physical medium like cables and signals.

2. Data Link Layer

Makes data error-free for the Physical Layer by framing and MAC addressing.

3. Network Layer

Handles IP addressing and routing to send data across different networks.

4. Transport Layer

Provides reliable or fast delivery using TCP/UDP and handles end-to-end communication.

5. Session Layer

Creates, manages, and ends communication sessions between devices.

6. Presentation Layer

Converts data format (encryption, compression, encoding) so devices can understand each other.

7. Application Layer

Provides network services to users (like email, browsing, file transfer).

13. IP address: An IP address is a unique number given to every device on a network so it can be identified and communicate with other devices.
14. Port address: A port address is a unique number used to identify a specific application or service running on a device.
15. Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection per second.
