Aim

To implement a Distance Vector Routing Protocol (DVR) to find the shortest path.

Theory (Very Simple)

DVR is based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
Each router maintains a table of distances to all nodes. Routers exchange tables with neighbors and update routes using:

Dx(y) = min { C(x,v) + Dv(y) }

This repeats until all routing tables become stable.

Procedure

Enter number of nodes.

Enter distances between nodes.

Generate initial routing tables.

Exchange tables between routers.

Update routes using Bellman-Ford formula.

Display final shortest paths for each node.

Conclusion

Distance Vector Routing was implemented and the shortest routes between nodes were calculated using Bellman-Ford updates.
