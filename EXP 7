Aim

To implement a Distance Vector Routing Protocol (DVR) to find the shortest path.

Expanded Theory (Simple & Clear)

Routing protocols help routers choose the best path to send data between networks. Distance Vector Routing (DVR) is one of the oldest and simplest routing techniques.

How DVR Works

Each router maintains a distance vector table that stores the distance to all other destinations in the network. The distance is usually measured in “hops.”

Routers exchange their tables with their neighbors periodically.
Based on this information, they update their own tables using the Bellman-Ford Algorithm:

Properties of DVR

Simple and easy to implement.

Updates happen periodically or when a link changes.

Routers do not have the full topology, only neighbor information.

Problems

Slow convergence.

Count-to-infinity problem (routing loops).

More traffic due to frequent updates.

Despite its limitations, DVR forms the basis of early routing algorithms like RIP (Routing Information Protocol).

Procedure

Enter number of nodes.

Enter distances between nodes.

Generate initial routing tables.

Exchange tables between routers.

Update routes using Bellman-Ford formula.

Display final shortest paths for each node.

Conclusion

Distance Vector Routing was implemented and the shortest routes between nodes were calculated using Bellman-Ford updates.
